KEY AND INSTRUCTIONS

The 'docked_models' folder contains all Cluspro-generated and HADDOCK-generated docked models of anti-Pfs25 antibodies docked to Pfs25 antigen. Within this folder, there are sub-folders, each containing docked models of a particular antibody-Pfs25 complex. The 'extract_epitope.py' script along with the 'epitope.py' script is used to extract epitope residues from each docked model and save them into a .csv file. 

A. Description of files in the 'Epibin_calculations' folder:

I. 
1. *_epi.csv (where * is the name of the antibody. Eg:  6b0a_epi.csv)

This csv file is a table listing the epitope residues for each of the docked model of that particular antibody - antigen complex one model per row.

2. *_*_score.csv (where * is the name of the antibody. Eg. 6b0a_6b0e_score.csv)

This csv file contains a matrix listing the epitope overlap scores between pairs of docked models, one from each antibody. Each cell contains the epitope overlap score between a particular pair of docked models. The name of the docked models comprising the pair being scored is indicated in the first row and first column (Eg: the 1190_1276_score.csv file contains 1190-Pfs25 docked models as rows and docked models of 1276-Pfs25 as columns. Each cell has a value of the epitope overlap score between a specific pair of docked models, one an 1190-Pfs25 docked model and the other a 1276-Pfs25 docked model).

3. *_score_T.csv (where * is the name of the antibody or repebody. Eg. 1190_1276_score_T.csv)

This csv file is a transpose of the corresponding *_score.csv file. For example, 1190_1276_score_T.csv is the file in which the rows and columns have been exchanged so that now the 1276-Pfs25 docked models are present as rows and the 1190-Pfs25 docked models are present in columns.

4. *_common_epitopes.csv (where * is the name of the antibody. Eg. 1190_1276_common_epitopes.csv)

This file lists the epitope residues common to a pair of docked models where each model is that of a different antibody. 1190_1276_common_epitopes.csv lists the common epitope residues between an 1190-Pfs25 docked model and 1276-Pfs25 docked model.

5. list_of_epitope_files

This file is a list of all the *_epi.csv files. This is used as an input for the script  Ab_common_epitopes.py.

6. list_common_epitope_scores

This file is a list of all the *_score.csv files and is used as an input for the script "antibodies_models_calculation_new.py". 


7. Ab_common_epitopes.py

This script reads in the 'list_of_epitope_files' and calculates the epitope overlap score between all pairs of docked models, one belonging to a set of antigen-specific antibody. The output of exceuting this script are the *_score.csv and *_common_epitope.csv files

8. antibodies_models_calculation_new.py

This script takes as input a user-defined threshold of the epitope overlap score (a value between 0 and 1), reads in the 'list_common_epitope_scores' file and calculates the Epibin-predicted competition among antigen-specific antibodies. The output of executing this script is a file named "antibody_epibin_EOS_(EOS_threshold).csv".

9. transpose_score.py
This script generates a transpose matrix of the matrix present in the *_score.csv files.

10. convert_into_matrix.py

This script takes as input the "antibody_epibin_EOS_(EOS_threshold).csv" file and generates a file with the Epibin-predicted competition values in a matrix-like format.
