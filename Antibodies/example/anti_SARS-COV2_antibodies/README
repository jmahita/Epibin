KEY AND INSTRUCTIONS

A. Description of files in the 'input_files' folder:

I. 
1. *_epi.csv (where * is the name of the antibody. Eg:  10954_epitope.csv)

This csv file is a table listing the epitope residues for each of the docked model of that particular antibody - antigen complex one model per row.

2. *_*_score.csv (where * is the name of the antibody. Eg. 10954_10989_score.csv)

This csv file contains a matrix listing the epitope overlap scores between pairs of docked models, one from each antibody. Each cell contains the epitope overlap score between a particular pair of docked models. The name of the docked models comprising the pair being scored is indicated in the first row and first column (Eg: the 10954_10989_score.csv file contains 10954-RBD docked models as rows and docked models of 10989-RBD as columns. Each cell has a value of the epitope overlap score between a specific pair of docked models, one an 10954-RBD docked model and the other a 10989-RBD docked model).

3. *_score_T.csv (where * is the name of the antibody or repebody. Eg. 10954_10989_score_T.csv)

This csv file is a transpose of the corresponding *_score.csv file. For example, 10954_10989_score_T.csv is the file in which the rows and columns have been exchanged so that now the 10989-RBD docked models are present as rows and the 10954-RBD docked models are present in columns.

4. *_common_epitopes.csv (where * is the name of the antibody. Eg. 10954_10989_common_epitopes.csv)

This file lists the epitope residues common to a pair of docked models where each model is that of a different antibody. 10954_10989_common_epitopes.csv lists the common epitope residues between an 10954-RBD docked model and 10989-RBD docked model.

5. list_of_epitope_files

This file is a list of all the *_epitope.csv files. This is used as an input for the script  Ab_common_epitopes.py.

6. list_common_epitope_scores

This file is a list of all the *_score.csv files and is used as an input for the script "antibodies_models_calculation_new.py". 

B. Description of files in the 'source_code' folder

7. Ab_common_epitopes.py

This script reads in the 'list_of_epitope_files' and calculates the epitope overlap score between all pairs of docked models, one belonging to a set of antigen-specific antibody. The output of exceuting this script are the *_score.csv and *_common_epitope.csv files

8. transpose_score.py
This script generates a transpose matrix of the matrix present in the *_score.csv files.

9. antibodies_models_calculation_new.py

This script takes as input a user-defined threshold of the epitope overlap score (a value between 0 and 1), reads in the 'list_common_epitope_scores' file and calculates the Epibin-predicted competition among antigen-specific antibodies. The output of executing this script is a file named "antibody_epibin_EOS_(EOS_threshold).csv".

10. convert_into_matrix.py

This script takes as input the "antibody_epibin_EOS_(EOS_threshold).csv" file and generates a file with the Epibin-predicted competition values in a matrix-like format.


C. Instructions on running the Epibin code for predicting competition among Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies:

1. Copy all *_epitope.csv files from "input_files" into a new folder
2. Copy the files "list_of_epitope_files" and "list_common_epitope_scores" into the same folder
3. Copy the scripts "Ab_common_epitopes.py","transpose_score.py" ,"antibodies_models_calculation_new.py" and "convert_into_matrix.py"  from the "source_code" folder into the new folder

4. Run the following commands in the order provided:
i. python3 Ab_common_epitopes.py
ii. python3 transpose_score.py
iii. python3 antibodies_models_calculation_new.py (threshold value = 0.45)
iv. python3 convert_into_matrix.py
